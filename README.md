# PCABM

This is the sample code for conducting pairwise covariates-adjusted stochastic block model (PCABM), which is a generalization of SBM that incorporates pairwise covariate information.

Simulation Example.ipynb is a a toy example illustrating how to use pcabm package, with data generating from a pcabm. Political Blog Example.ipynb is applying mle of pcabm to a famous real world data set. 

Followings are introductions to pcabm's files:
commFunc.py     -some common functions that will be used often.
dcbm.py         -calculating mle for degree corrected block model
pcabm.py        -calculating mle for pairwise covariates-adjusted stochastic block model
sc.py           -different spectral clustering methods
