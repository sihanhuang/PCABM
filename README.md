# PCABM

This is the sample code for conducting pairwise covariates-adjusted stochastic block model (PCABM), which is a generalization of SBM that incorporates pairwise covariate information.

Simulation Example.ipynb is a a toy example illustrating how to use pcabm package, with data generating from a pcabm. Political Blog Example.ipynb is applying mle of pcabm to a famous real world data set. 

Followings are introductions to pcabm's files:

- commFunc.py : some common functions that will be used often.
- dcbm.py     : calculating mle for degree corrected block model
- pcabm.py    : calculating mle for pairwise covariates-adjusted stochastic block model
- sc.py       : different spectral clustering methods
